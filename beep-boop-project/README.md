# Beep Boop Number Translator

#### Webpage form to convert users numerical input into specific pattern detailed below, 17 Aug 2018.
#### By Talia Haller

## Description

Creates a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. For example, the number 10 is replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 is with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

Also a user can enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
